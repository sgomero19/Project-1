PROJECT 1 – GROUP 8

Problem statement: 
-	In such a high volatility from the big tech companies, client is looking to invest in different sector rather than tech.
-	With the current events globally, let’s look at Aero Space and Defense sector and analyze 5 years of history of 3 stocks: RTX (Raytheon), GD (General Dynamic), LMT (Lockheed). They are billion market cap companies with high value contract all over the world. 
-	Also, those 3 companies have had an outstanding dividend payout which a few big techs don’t offer investors now.

analyze:

1.	Annually, Quarterly, monthly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
2.	The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
3.	The total stock volume of the stock, 50-day volume trading average of 400k or more
4.	measure the ROC (Rate of Change = [(Current Value of Stock/Previous Value of Stock) – 1] * 100.) and compare to the index S&P500 in the same period
5.	create a trending visualization to conclude which stock should be invested.
