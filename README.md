PROJECT 1 – GROUP 8

Problem statement: 
-	In such a high volatility from the big tech companies, client is looking to invest in different sector rather than tech.
-	With the current events globally, let’s look at Aero Space and Defense sector and analyze 240 days of history of 3 stocks: RTX (Raytheon), GD (General Dynamic), LMT (Lockheed). They are billion market cap companies with high value contract all over the world. 
-	Also, those 3 companies have had an outstanding dividend payout which a few big techs don’t offer investors now.

analyze:


1.	The total stock volume of each stock
2.	measure the volatility of each stock per weekly, monthly
3.	measure the ROC (Rate of Change = [(Current Value of Stock/Previous Value of Stock) – 1] * 100.) and compare to the index S&P500 in the same period
5.	create a trending visualization to conclude which stock should be invested, stock must meet all 3 requirements:
     +50-day volume trading average of 400k or more
  	 +volatility is less than 20%
  	 +ROC (gain) must be higher than S&P500
